# Railway Configuration Conflict Resolution

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
Railway is **STILL** using the backend's `Dockerfile.railway` instead of Strapi's `Dockerfile`, causing:
```
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref alq66ikuow9y7urposnz7s8ot::vs37cb5vnswxumzzu7wt9r8d7: "/app/backend/node_modules": not found
```

## üîß SOLUTION: Complete Service Isolation

### Option 1: Separate Railway Project (RECOMMENDED)

**Step 1: Login to Railway**
```bash
railway login
```

**Step 2: Create Completely Separate Project**
```bash
cd /home/litvagent/hr-ai-marketplace/apps/backend-cms/strapi
railway init --name "strapi-cms"
```

**Step 3: Set Critical Variables**
```bash
# Force correct Dockerfile
railway variables set RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH="Dockerfile"

# Set all Strapi variables
./setup-railway-env.sh
```

**Step 4: Deploy**
```bash
railway up
```

### Option 2: Railway Dashboard (MANUAL)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
2. **Create NEW Project** (not service in existing project)
3. **Connect GitHub Repository**
4. **Set Root Directory**: `apps/backend-cms/strapi/`
5. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - `RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH=Dockerfile`
   - All other variables from setup script
6. **Deploy**

### Option 3: Temporary Root Configuration Fix

**If you want to keep using the same Railway project:**

1. **Rename root railway.toml** (already done):
   ```bash
   mv /home/litvagent/hr-ai-marketplace/railway.toml /home/litvagent/hr-ai-marketplace/railway.toml.backend
   ```

2. **Create Strapi service in existing project**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/litvagent/hr-ai-marketplace/apps/backend-cms/strapi
   railway init
   railway variables set RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH="Dockerfile"
   ./setup-railway-env.sh
   railway up
   ```

3. **Restore backend configuration** (after Strapi is deployed):
   ```bash
   cd /home/litvagent/hr-ai-marketplace
   mv railway.toml.backend railway.toml
   ```

## üîç Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:
- Build logs show "Using Dockerfile" (not "Using Detected Dockerfile")
- No `--from=deps` errors
- Build uses Strapi's simple Dockerfile
- Service runs on port 1337

## üö® Why This Happens

Railway prioritizes:
1. Root `railway.toml` (highest priority)
2. Service-specific `railway.toml`
3. Environment variables

The root `railway.toml` was overriding the Strapi configuration!

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

- Railway uses Strapi's `Dockerfile` (simple, no multi-stage)
- No more `COPY --from=deps` errors
- Clean, successful build
- Strapi service running independently
