# Strapi MCP Integration Guide

## Current Issues & Solutions

### 1. MCP Tool Connection Issues
The MCP Strapi tool is connecting but showing no content types. This suggests:
- Strapi is running but has no content types created yet
- Authentication might be required for MCP access
- API endpoints might not be properly configured

### 2. Authentication Issues (401 Unauthorized)
The admin panel is showing 401 errors, which means:
- No admin user has been created yet
- JWT tokens are not configured properly
- Admin authentication is failing

### 3. CSP Violations Still Occurring
Our security configuration might not be taking effect because:
- Strapi needs to be restarted after config changes
- The security config might not be in the right location
- Railway might be overriding our settings

## Solutions

### Option 1: Create Admin User First
1. Go to `https://backend-cms-strapi-production.up.railway.app/admin`
2. Create your first admin user account
3. This should resolve the 401 errors

### Option 2: Alternative MCP Tools
If the Strapi MCP tool continues to have issues, we can use:

#### A. Direct API Calls
```bash
# Test Strapi API directly
curl -X GET https://backend-cms-strapi-production.up.railway.app/api/content-types
```

#### B. Strapi CLI
```bash
# Use Strapi CLI to create content types
npx strapi generate:content-type --name Article
```

#### C. Custom MCP Tool
Create a custom MCP tool that uses direct HTTP requests instead of the Strapi SDK.

### Option 3: Clerk Authentication Integration
For production use, we should integrate Clerk authentication:

1. **Install Clerk Strapi Plugin**
2. **Configure JWT validation**
3. **Set up user synchronization**
4. **Enable multi-tenant user management**

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create Admin User**: Access the admin panel and create your first user
2. **Test MCP Tool**: Once authenticated, test the MCP tool again
3. **Create Content Types**: Use the admin panel to create content types
4. **Integrate Clerk**: For production authentication
5. **Test API Endpoints**: Verify all endpoints are working

## Environment Variables Needed

Add these to Railway for better MCP integration:
```
STRAPI_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
STRAPI_ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
STRAPI_PUBLIC_URL=https://backend-cms-strapi-production.up.railway.app
```
